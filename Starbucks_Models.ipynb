Hope that would give some insights on the future marketing campaign.\n","\n","Notes of this project:\n","\n","* I removed several samlpe with age 118 because these samples are also lack of many features. I strongly believe the samples of age 118 are Nan. It is a good learning process to the business world.\n","\n","*   Female customers have higher density in higher income spectum (75k up)   while male custoers have higher density in lower income spectum (75k below).\n","\n","\n","Finally, I am impressed that the random forest classifer explain the dataset with 88% accuracy and 80% F1 score.\n","\n"]}]}
